Using a for loop:
The for loop is the most common way of iterating through an array. You can use the length property of the array to set the loop limit, and the index variable to access the array elements.

Example:
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}

Using a forEach loop:
The forEach method allows you to iterate through an array without using an explicit loop variable. It takes a function as an argument, which is called for each element in the array.
Example:
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

array.forEach(element => console.log(element));

Using a for-of loop:
The for-of loop is a newer feature in JavaScript that allows you to iterate over the values of an iterable object (like an array) without using an index variable.

Example:
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (const element of array) {
  console.log(element);
}

Using the map method:
The map method is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. It can also be used to iterate through an array and perform some action on each element.

Example:
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

array.map(element => console.log(element));
